## Installation and up and running steps

### Running the server
1. Open terminal and change directory to reach `server`.
2. Inside `server` run `npm install`. 
3. Once installation of `node_modules` is done, run `npm run start` and the server should run on `localhost:8001`.

### Running the client
1. Open terminal and change directory to reach `client`.
2. Inside `client` run `npm install`.
3. Once installation of `node_modules` is done, run `npm run start` and the server should run on `localhost:3000`.
Note: port number i.e. 3000 in the above line can be different on your local system if the port might already be in use.
4. Inside `client` run `npm run build` to create production build.
5. Inside `client` run `npm run format` to format the code.
